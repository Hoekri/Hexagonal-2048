# Hexagonal-2048

Clone of the popular 2048 game by Gabriele Cirulli, except on hexagonal grids of various shapes.
Now with two new modes: Fibonacci and Triple

 - Double: Normal 2048, two equal numbers combine to their sum.
 - Triple: Three equal numbers combine to their sum.
 - Fibonacci: Combine consecutive terms to their sum.

## Goal

Try to make the largest number by sliding numbers into each other.

## Controls

You can click drag and release the mouse, use touch or use the `awedxz` keys to pick a direction.

## Additional actions

 - `r` to rotate the board.
 - `pgdn` to make one random move.
 - `end` to have the game make random moves untill game end.
 - `home` to move the same direction as much as possible until game end.

For sharing the source code of hexagonal tetris: [hexagonal tetris](https://space-cat-atelier.itch.io/honeycomb)!
It inspired me to finally make and share this hexagonal version of 2048.

For sharing some: [nice contrasting colors](https://sashamaps.net/docs/resources/20-colors/)! Choosing colors is hard.
